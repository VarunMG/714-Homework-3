# 714-Homework-3

For spectral_wave_code.m, put in the values of N that you want for grid spacing then run code. It depends on spectral_lap where you give it a 2D 
scalar function on a grid and it computes the discrete laplacian using spectram methods on a Cheybschev grid. 

B_error compute the error for the specific initial condition in C.e
